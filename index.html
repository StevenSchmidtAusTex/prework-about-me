      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey, I'm Steven. It's a pleasure to be working with all of you over these next few months.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Mont Belvieu Texas, a little town just to the East of Houston. Among the pines and the oil refinery stacks.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a big fan of urban and rural exploration, boxing, and I'm looking to get into fencing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd love a job in any sort of creative or security role, but ideally something in demand. I'll go wherever I'm needed.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a little town south of Austin called Buda.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web and software development offer a career path that is both useful and rewarding. I've spent most of my life doing manual labor, and I'm not getting any younger.</p>
